In bowl, with wire whisk, stir flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add milk, butter, and egg and stir until flour is moistened. Heat griddle or 12-inch skillet over medium heat until drop of water sizzles; brush lightly with oil. Pour batter by scant 1/4 cups onto hot griddle, making a few pancakes at a time.
