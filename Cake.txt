Gently melt the butter, chocolate and syrup in a large pan over a low heat, stirring frequently until smooth, then cool for about 15mins. Stir the crushed biscuits and sweets into the pan until well mixed, pour into a 17cm/6 Â½ inch square tin lined with non-stick baking paper and spread the mixture to roughly level it. Chill until hard and then take out of tin and remove paper. Cut into fingers. Store in an air-tight container.
